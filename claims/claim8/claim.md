# Claim 8 - Analyzing the Application for Diffie-Hellman
As described in Sec. 5.2, we successfully execute the immutability, escape, pointer, and pass-through analyses on the Diffie-Hellman case study, which establishes the conditions (C1)-(C4) and (C6)-(C8) (as stated in Sec. 4.3).

`run.sh` supports this claim by running these analyses.
